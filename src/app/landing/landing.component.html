      In an ever-changing world where family members often disperse and travel
      far and wide, the rich tapestry of our heritage and cultural values can
      slowly unravel, slipping through the fingers of generations like grains of
      sand. As time marches forward, the bonds that once held tribes and
      villages together begin to fray, leaving us with a sense of longing for
      the connections that once defined us. While the digital age has brought us
      a plethora of social media and networking apps, these platforms have
      largely failed to address the pressing issue of the disappearing ties
      between family members. Instead, they have focused on connecting us to
      larger communities, leaving our closest relatives scattered and
      disconnected.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      But it doesn't have to be this way. There is a genuine yearning for a
      solution to this problem, a deep-seated desire to preserve the ties that
      bind us to our roots and to the people who share our bloodline. Imagine
      being able to, with a simple lookup or at a glance, connect with your
      wife's uncle's brother or to see the lineage of your grandfather's
      brother's wife's sister's son – a digital family tree that makes sense of
      the intricate web of relationships that define us.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Moreover, envision having the ability to reach out to a close-knit
      community, asking questions and receiving answers from those who share
      your history and traditions. Picture a digital family bible, a repository
      of memories that not only preserves the past but allows you to travel back
      in time and witness the events that shaped your lineage. Think of
      bibliographies that are open-source, with family members contributing
      anecdotes and insights about the lives of their loved ones, even those who
      have passed on.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This vision extends beyond words and into the realm of multimedia. Imagine
      capturing life's most precious moments – births, weddings, graduations –
      through pictures, audio recordings, and videos, ensuring that the deeds
      and milestones of your family members live on, vibrant and enduring,
      rather than being relegated to the pages of burial brochures. Envision a
      virtual village, a digital oasis where the essence of your family's
      heritage thrives, transcending the limitations of time and space.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The app I envision is a comprehensive solution, a digital hub where the
      past, present, and future of your family converge. It is my fervent desire
      to make this app open source, allowing everyone to contribute to its
      growth and enrichment. Your suggestions and ideas are not only welcome but
      integral to the realization of this ambitious project.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In conclusion, our shared heritage and familial bonds are too precious to
      let slip away into obscurity. With the right tools and the collective
      effort of our extended family – both near and far – we can create an
      enduring legacy, a digital tapestry that weaves together the threads of
      our past, present, and future. This is not just an app; it is a bridge to
      our roots, a testament to our shared history, and a beacon of hope for
      generations to come.

    Most of the time, family history and lineage is lost. people disperse and
    travel far and wide. As a result of this, heritage and cultural values are
    lost. As this continues for multiple generations, little can be said of the
    values a tribe or village holds dear to themselves. There are a plethora of
    social medium and networking apps however they have failed to address the
    disappearing bond between family members and have instead focused on the
    larger communities. This neednt be so.
    <br />

    I am earnestly seeking for a solution to the problem. I want family ties to
    be preserved. I want to at a glance or with a simple lookup, connect with
    the brother of my wifes uncle, oe see my grand fathers brothers wife sisters
    son :) If that makes sense. I also want to ask a close knitted community
    questions and have them answer the questions. I want to have a family bible
    that would ppreserve memories. I want to travel back in time and see what
    happened at a certaiin time. I want bibliographies of people to be open
    source. Family members contributing to say a thing or two about the life of
    another person, a deceased member etc.

    <br />
    I want to capture life's event of the lineage through pictures and audio and
    videos. I want the deeds of people to like on and not just be forgotten in
    burial brochures. I want a village away from village
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    This app as you have sen would be well packed. It is also my plan to make it
    open source so that every one can contribute. Your suggestions are welcome
